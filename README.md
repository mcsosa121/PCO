Coin Counting Program
Coin Counting Program Take a picture with an webcam or upload a pretaken picture of coins. Must be taken on a black background with a green reference coin. For the program to work as of now you need to have 32 bit java and jmf (java media framework) installed. However if you just want to just use pretaken pictures from on your computer and not use the webcam, you dont need to have 32 bit java and jmf installed.
